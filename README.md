This project is partnered with SDK.finance 💳, a white-label software provider specialising in FinTech and PayTech solutions. 

Their flagship product facilitates the rapid and streamlined development of digital wallets, neo-banking platforms, and various financial services. 

The collaboration🤝 focuses on leveraging their platform to analyse a unique dataset of synthetic transaction data within digital wallets to detect fraudulent activity. 

The project aligns with both product development and data management life cycles, encompassing data preparation, data visualisation, data engineering, algorithm selection, analysis, and integration into transaction processing flows🧑‍💻. 

The specific objectives include selecting a relevant dataset of synthetic transactions, analysing the data to uncover anomalies and patterns 🤥, developing machine learning models for fraud detection, and evaluating the models. 

By utilising SDK.finance's API-driven platform and focusing on synthetic transactions within digital wallets which amount to more than 16 million, the research aims to enhance security and fraud prevention in the financial ecosystem 🔧.
